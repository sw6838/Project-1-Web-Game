# Project-1-Web-Game
Inspiration for the Game:
            I Just wanted to start with an easy game, and when I searched online for the simple java games there were only few choices like Tic, Tac, Toe; Pong and Maze game. I found Pong easy to understand so I chose Pong.

Explain the controls and how to play the game:

            It will be a two player game, and is a computer version of Table Tennis game. I will use two paddles on the sides of the screen to represent the two players and a ball in the middle of the screen before we start the game.
            If the ball will hit the wall during the play then it will be score for the other player.

List the technologies used to build the game:
            VS Code, Github, HTML, Javascript, CSS, 
            1 html file
            1 CSS file
